Version
-------

This is **version 1** of the specification, as shown by the `v: 1` in the [structure](#structure) section below. This ensures that your build tools, or server-side compile steps, are speaking the same language as the copy of Ractive running in your app in the browser.


Structure
---------

```js
{
  v: 1, /* Template spec version */
  t: [  /* items in the main template */ ],
  p: {  /* Optional hash of partials */
    foo: [ /* items in the 'foo' partial */ ]
  }
}
```



Type code reference
-------------------

Each item in the template (other than text items, which are represented as strings) has a `t` property indicating its type. These codes are as follows:

```js
[
  INTERPOLATOR : 2,
  TRIPLE       : 3,
  SECTION      : 4,
  ELEMENT      : 7,
  PARTIAL      : 8,
  COMMENT      : 9
]
```


Format
------

### Text

Plain text is represented as a string, whether it will become a text node or an element attribute.

```js
// Before
'I am some text'

// After
'I am some text'
```

### Interpolator

The interpolator is the atomic unit of data-binding.

```js
// Before
'{{foo.bar}}'

// After
{
  t: 2,
  r: 'foo.bar'    // the reference
}
```

As an alternative to a reference, an interpolator may have an *expression*...

```js
// Before
'{{foo + bar}}'

// After
{
  t: 2,
  x: {                   // the expression
    r: ['foo', 'bar'],   // the references used in the expression
    s: '${0}+${1}'       // a string representing the expression
  }
}
```

...or a *reference expression*, which at runtime will resolve to a reference, and can thus be used for two-way binding:

```js
// Before
'{{foo[bar]}}'

// After
{
  t: 2,
  kx: {
    r: 'foo',            // the base reference
    m: [                 // the 'members' of the reference expression
      {
        t: 30,           // the type of member (see below)
        n: 'bar'         // the name of the member
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See the sections on [expressions](#expressions) and [reference expressions](#reference-expressions) for more information.

Expressions and reference expressions can also be used with [triples](#triple) and [sections](#section). For brevity, they are omitted from the examples below.

### Triple

```js
// Before
'{{{foo}}}'

// After
{
  t: 3,
  r: 'foo'    // the reference
}
```

### Section

```js
// Before
'{{#foo}}...{{/foo}}'

// After
{
  t: 4,
  r: 'foo',
  f: ['...']  // the section fragment
}
```

Sections can be 'inverted' - in other words, they only render when their condition (`foo` in the example) is falsy:

```js
// Before
'{{^foo}}...{{/foo}}'

// After
{
  t: 4,
  r: 'foo',
  f: ['...'],
  n: 1        // 'n' means 'inverted'. `1` is used instead of `true`, to save space
}
```

Note: this will likely change in the near future. In regular Mustache, lists, objects and conditional sections are all treated similarly, and differentiated at render time. Only inverted sections look different. Some templating languages, e.g. [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), allow the template author to specify the type of section, which is useful.


### Element

An 'element' may in fact be a component - this is determined at render time. As far as the parser is concerned, they are the same.

```js
// Before
'<div id="box" class="type-{{foo}}" intro="fade:{delay:500}" on-click="log:{{hello}}">...</div>'

// After
{
  t: 7,
  e: 'div',
  a: {               // attributes (should only exist if there are one or more attributes)
    id: 'box',       // static attributes are stored as strings
    class: [         // dynamic attributes are stored as fragments
      'type-',
      { t: 2, r: 'foo' }
    ]
  },
  t1: {              // t1 is `intro`, t2 is `outro`, t0 is `intro-outro`
    n: 'fade',       // directive name
    a: [{            // directive arguments - `a` - are parsed
      delay: 500
    }]
  },
  v: {               // proxy event directives - a map of name:definition pairs
    click: {
      n: 'log',
      d: [{          // this time, the directive has dynamic arguments - `d` instead of `a`
        t: 2,
        r: 'hello'
      }]
    }
  },
  f: ['...']         // element children fragment
}
```


### Partial

Partials are markers for places where template snippets should be inserted.

```js
// Before
{{>foo}}

// After
{
  t: 8,
  r: 'foo'
}
```


### Comment

With the standard parser, comments are stripped unless the `stripComments` option is false.

```js
// Before
'<!-- This is a comment -->'

// After
{
  t: 9,
  c: ' This is a comment '
}
```


Expressions
-----------

While Mustache brands itself as a 'logic-less' templating language, Ractive templates can feature JavaScript expressions. See the [docs](http://docs.ractivejs.org/latest/expressions) for more detail.

Ractive's built-in parser is therefore capable of parsing JavaScript expressions to an abstract syntax tree (AST). However the AST is not transported as part of the template; instead, it is used to extract references from the expression (for data-binding purposes) and then flattened to a string representation.

Only a subset of the infinite range of JavaScript expressions is supported (albeit an infinite subset...) - those which do not use assignment operators (such as `=` or `++`), regular expressions, function literals, or `new`/`delete`/`void` operators. This is to ensure security and prevent side-effects.


Reference expressions
---------------------

A subset of expressions fall into the category of *reference expressions* - those expressions which, when their references have been resolved and they can be evaluated, will resolve to references. For example the `foo[bar]` expression, once we know that `bar === 'qux'`, is equivalent to `foo.qux`. Treating these expressions differently allows us to perform certain tricks that would otherwise be impossible, such as two-way data binding. This turns out to be incredibly useful when building interactive tabular interfaces, for example.

Reference expressions are denoted by the property name `kx`, for reasons we won't go into.

We'll use a horribly contrived reference expression to illustrate how they are represented in parsed templates:

```js
// Before
'{{one[two]["three"].four[five+6]}}'

// After
{
  t: 2,
  kx: {
    r: 'one'      // the 'base reference'
    m: [          // the 'members'
      { t: 30, n: 'two' },
      { r: [], s: 'three' },
      'four',
      { r: ['five'], s: '${0}+6' }
    ]
  }
}
```

Type `30` (the first member) is used to denote a reference. The second and final members are expressions in their own right. The third is a property name, which is stored as a string.


Directives
----------

As described earlier, directives look like attributes but aren't rendered to the DOM as attributes. They can be **transition** directives (`intro`, `outro`, or `intro-outro`), **decorator** directives, or **event directives** (`on-click`, `on-mouseover` and so on). There are some rules:

* There can be zero or one `intro` (denoted in the template as `t1`) and zero or one `outro` (`t2`). `intro-outro` (`t0`) counts as one of each.
* There can be zero or one `decorator` (`o`).
* There can be as many event directives as you like, but only one of each kind. Different events that shared a handler can be chained: `on-change-input='update'`.

In their simplest form, decorators are represented as strings:

```js
// Before
'<div on-click="activate">...</div>'

// After
{
  t: 7,
  e: 'div',
  v: {
    click: 'activate'
  }
}
```

However a directive may have arguments, in which case the directive template is an object rather than a string. If the arguments are static (no data-binding), they are converted to objects at parse time. The directive name is denoted by `n`, and the arguments are denoted by `a`.

```js
// Before
'<div on-click="activate:{foo:1,bar:2},42">...</div>'

// After
{
  t: 7,
  e: 'div',
  v: {
    click: {
      n: 'activate',
      a: [
        { foo: 1, bar: 2 },
        42
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If the arguments are dynamic, they are denoted by `d` instead, which is a fragment. This instructs Ractive's renderer to set up the appropriate data binding.

```js
// Before
'<div on-click="activate:{message:{{message}}}">...</div>'

// After
{
  t: 7,
  e: 'div',
  v: {
    click: {
      n: 'activate',
      d: [
        '{message:',
        { t: 2, r: 'message' },
        '}'
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This fragment will be parsed whenever the event fires.
